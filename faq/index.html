				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>All you need to do is to provide a valid email address and a password. Your account will be ready, however, it will remain in UNVERIFIED status. The registered account must be verified by clicking on the activation link sent via email to the registered email address, without which your access to the data mapper app is blocked. </p><br/>
					<p>Sometimes, the activation email might end up in the spam folder - please check the spam folder for the activation email.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do I have to sign up?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Every registered user would be able to maintain his/her own maps (private) catering to a set of source and target files along with the mapping and transformation rules governing the mapping process. These maps would be treated as private resources. The same applies to jobs created by the user, they are treated as private jobs.</p> <br/>
					<p>However, one can choose to share a map enabling access to other registered users who can clone a copy to their private workspace and use it as needed</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I create multiple accounts?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sure, as long as each account is associated with a distinct email address.</p><br/>
					<p>TIP: If you are using google hosted email or Gmail account, an alias created with a suffix of + sign and a keyword would qualify for a distinct email id </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a map?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A map is an artifact that you create for transforming a source file in a specific format to a target file format. The process involves defining attribute definition of source and target files at sheet level and a mapping construct that defines rules of attribute mapping between the source and target at sheet level. </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I make changes to an existing map (Edit)?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sure, once the map is created it is identified with a unique id. Any changes via the edit map facility will update the associated map on the repository.</p><br/>
					<p>However, be aware that any existing job that refers to the map will now inherit the changes automatically.</p><br/>
					<p>TIP: If you want to maintain versions of the map, you can clone the existing map and create a new map and impart changes on the cloned map</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are mapping rules?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A map contains a collection of rules around attribute mapping and transformation. They can be classified as:</p><br/>
					<p>1) Source Validation Rules<p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied as a pre-processor validating the source data before applying mapping rules. Any violation would halt the mapping process with appropriate error conditions</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Attribute data type definition (String, Date or Number)</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Attribute constraints (unique, required) </p>
					<p>2) Target Validation Rules</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied as a post-processor validating the mapped result. Any violation would halt the mapping process with appropriate error conditions</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Attribute data type definition (String, Date or Number) </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Attribute constraints (unique, required) </p>
					<p>3) Mapping Rules </p><br/>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mapping rules that identify a source attribute to be mapped to a target attribute. The mapping can be a simple copy mapping or transformations involving computation or processing</p>
					<p>4) Map & Transform Rules</p><br/>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Governs the transformation process involving computation, aggregation or other forms pre-processing on the source attribute before assigning to a target attribute </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is a job?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>An attempt to map a source file to a target file using the rules defined in a map. In other words, execution of a map by providing an input file that conforms to the source file format and attributes definition as defined in the map.</p></br>
					<p>A created job can be executed any number of times, each time it looks up the current definition of the referred map and produces an output file.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) A row number where the headers are expected to be found on the source excel file </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) Should the source and target format is same, a flag to indicate the reuse of source file requirement </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) Should the mapping process need to evaluate and consider commonality and differences with the last processed source file, a flag to indicate the diff processing requirement </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the stages in designing a map?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>On the Data Mapper app, designing a map involves four stages:</p> <br/>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Map specification - Defining name and map settings</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Source Validation Rules - Defining source attribute definition and constraints </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Target Validation Rules - Defining target attribute definition and constraints </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Mapping Rules - Defining rules for mapping a source attribute to a target attribute </p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the preprocessors available?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Any rule intended to make changes (update) to the looked up attribute like case conversion, number rounding, conditional skip, deduplication and date range fix would require a valid definition for the lookup. Only exception is 'Skip N Rows' which simply skips the first N rows from processing without any concern over the data.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does the 'Date range fix' rule work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>A source sheet may contain one or more date attributes. A date range for the current dataset on the specified attribute can be inferred based on the lower and upper date bounds. A date range fix rule expects a target from and to bounds for a date range. </p><br/>
					<p>With this target date range, algorithmically extrapolate or interpolate a found date value on a given row; thus shifting the dates to a new range.</p><br/>
					<p>This preprocessor is useful when you are trying to shift forward or backwards a set of records based on a date attribute.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does 'Empty Value' rule do?</a>

			</li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does a case conversion preprocessor do?</a>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the data types supported?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The rules configured on the source sheet may require certain dependencies based on the rules applied. For example, a date-oriented rule expects the source attribute to be of date type, number-processing rule would expect the type to be of number.
